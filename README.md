# Promillo

## General Approach and Idea

App used for scanning alcohol and getting recomendations by AI for mixed drinks.
Also Supports (actually requires propably) adding potential friends, additional ingredient and desired flavor for recomended drinks for a whole friend group.

Currently only possible by scanning EAN-8 barcodes.
For future EAN-13 barcodes and regular images are desired.
